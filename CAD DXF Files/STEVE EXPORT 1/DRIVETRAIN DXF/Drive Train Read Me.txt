Sheet Metal Parts are labeled by (thickness and "SM" and "Bend")
For example (0.125 SM Bend) means that the sheet metal thickness of the part is 1/8" and there is a bend in the part.
For the bearing blocks or shaft mounts, the metal stock thickness is given - (1.000 Al Stock) is just 1 inch thick aluminum stock.
Bend locations are indicated by two small rectangular cuts in the 2d sketch - dimensioned at 0.125"x0.375" normal or 0.125"x0.25" if the part is small
The rectangular cuts can be edited to whatever you need to bend the sheet metal part. Currently all parts are bent at 90 degrees.

SEE "Drive Train Numerical Count" for how many of each part to make

PARTS:
Custom Belt Pulley Hex Hub (0.1875 SM) = a 3/16" hub that fits into a 0.5" hex shaft

Mounting Bracket 1 - toughbox-mini - underside (0.125 SM Bend) = bent sheet metal part to mount our toughboxes

Mounting Bracket 2 - toughbox-mini (0.125 SM Bend) = second bent sheet metal part to mount our toughboxes

Wheel Drop Down Plate (0.0625 SM) = simply a small 1/16" sheet metal plate

Wheel Mount Support Plate (0.125 SM) = simply a small 1/8" sheet metal plate

Bearing Block Drivetrain (1.000 Al Stock) = bearing block for supporting a drive shaft with a bearing of OD 1.125"

Shaft Mount Drivetrain (1.000 Al Stock) = holds a 0.5" OD steel wheel shaft

Wheel Mount Support Plate - drive wheel (0.125 SM) = similar to the above 1/8" sheet metal plate, just different size and mount holes
