Chassis Part 1 through 8 are the 1x1x1/8 Aluminum Square Tube - (cut to length by each CAD profile)
There are no parts 5 or 6 because they were omitted during the design process.

Parts 7 and 8 are replaced by Parts 9,10,11,12

Two dxf profile sides are provided (horizontal face and vertical sides) - all holes are milled completely through. Exceptions stated (such as a blank face)

Sheet Metal Parts are labeled by (thickness and "SM" and "Bend")
For example (0.125 SM Bend) means that the sheet metal thickness of the part is 1/8" and there is a bend in the part.
Bend locations are indicated by two small rectangular cuts in the 2d sketch - dimensioned at 0.125"x0.375" normal or 0.125"x0.25" if the part is small.
The rectangular cuts can be edited to whatever you need to bend the sheet metal part. Currently all parts are bent at 90 degrees.

Important: Mirrored Parts are just duplicate entries of the original part - bend the part in the opposite direction along the same bend line.

SEE "Chassis Numerical Count" for the number of each part to make


PARTS:
Chassis Part1 		= Outer Length that forms the side frame perimeter and has wheel mounts
Chassis Part2 		= Back Width that forms the back frame perimeter of our robot
Chassis Part3 		= Outer lengths that form the front frame perimeter of our robot
Chassis Part4 		= Inner Length that contains mounts for the toughboxes and wheels

Chassis Part9		= Inner Width that connects to our climber
Chassis Part10		= Frontal Length that forms the front frame (inside frame perimeter)
Chassis Part11		= Tiny Piece that connects Part 9 to the chassis
Chassis Part12		= Tiny Spacing Piece that spaces part 10 from part 9 (3/4 inches)



Chassis Connector Plate (0.125 SM) 				= Generic gusset plate that connects other pieces together plate to plate
Chassis Corner Plate (0.125 SM) 				= Connects the exterior four corners of our robot

Chassis Tower Bracket Part1 (0.125 SM Bend)			= 90 degree bent aluminum sheet metal that connects the front two legs of the tower to the chassis
Chassis Tower Support Plate - for bracket 1  (0.125 SM)		= simple 1/8" aluminum sheet metal piece that bolts to the otherside of the tower legs
Chassis Tower Bracket Part2 (0.125 SM Bend)			= 90 degree bent aluminum sheet metal that connects the back leg of the tower to the chassis
Chassis Tower Bracket Part3 (0.125 SM Bend)			= 90 degree bent aluminum sheet metal that connects the corner back leg of the tower to the chassis




OMIT: (Bumper Mounts Not Updated)
[
Chassis Bumper Mount - front - end (0.125 SM Bend) 		= bent sheet metal part that connects to the front bumpers
Chassis Bumper Mount - front - end - large (0.125 SM Bend) 	= a larger bent sheet metal part that connects to the front bumpers
Chassis Bumper Mount - side - center (0.125 SM Bend) 		= bent sheet metal part that connects to the side bumpers from the center
Chassis Bumper Mount - side - ends (0.125 SM Bend) 		= bent sheet metal part that connects to the side bumpers
Chassis Bumper Mount - back (0.125SM Bend) 			= bent sheet metal part that connnects to the back bumpers
Chassis Bumper Mount - back - mirror (01.125 SM Bend) 		= MIRRORED bent sheet metal part that connects to the back bumpers
