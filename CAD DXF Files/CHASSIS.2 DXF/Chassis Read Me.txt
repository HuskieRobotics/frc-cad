Sheet Metal Parts are labeled by (thickness and "SM" and "Bend")
For example (0.125 SM Bend) means that the sheet metal thickness of the part is 1/8" and there is a bend in the part.
Bend locations are indicated by two small rectangular cuts in the 2d sketch - dimensioned at 0.125"x0.375" normal or 0.125"x0.25" if the part is small.
The rectangular cuts can be edited to whatever you need to bend the sheet metal part. Currently all parts are bent at 90 degrees.

Important: Mirrored Parts are just duplicate entries of the original part - bend the part in the opposite direction along the same bend line.

SEE "Chassis Numerical Count" for the number of each part to make
