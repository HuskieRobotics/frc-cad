Parts are organized by material and thickness in directory.
Material, thickness and presence of bend is indicated in parenthesis after part name. 

Parts including bends which are sensitive to direction are marked (Material thickness BEND - SENSITIVE) and also have 3-view engineering drawings (saved as PDFs) 
under the same name to allow you to easily tell the direction of the bend and final shape of the part.

Bends are indicated by .125*.25 inch rectangles centered about the bend line (the .25 inch sides are paralell to the bend line). 
Moses and I are working on a way to indicate them using construction lines, but it makes exporting quite tricky.







If thickness in part name and where in the directory the part is organized conflicts, or file opening problems exist, please email me at arpan.rau@gmail.com.

If there's any way to streamline this exporting process for you, please let us know.
