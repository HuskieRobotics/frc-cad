Sheet Metal Parts are labeled by (thickness and "SM" and "Bend")
For example (0.125 SM Bend) means that the sheet metal thickness of the part is 1/8" and there is a bend in the part.
Bend locations are indicated by two small rectangular cuts in the 2d sketch - dimensioned at 0.125"x0.375" normal or 0.125"x0.25" if the part is small

SEE "Drive Train Numerical Count" for how many of each part to make
